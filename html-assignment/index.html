        Hello! My name is <em>Keylah Willette </em>and I'm from Ottawa, Canada. I'm currently a student at Algonquin College taking the Interactive Media Design course. I am a reliable, hardworking and creative student who enjoys working on various art and design projects. My favourite things to do include drawing, reading, writing and playing games. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I have some experience with design from using Adobe products during highschool communications classes, but I don't have much experience with web development and coding. In this course, I'm looking forward to learning more about how <abbr>HTML</abbr> works and how to create a custom website from scratch. So far I have enjoyed the classes and look forward to attending more.
